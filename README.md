# Kambiz’s dotfiles

All credit goes to [Denys Dovhan](https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles) who created the Zsh spaceship prompt and wrapped up the following features into a dotfiles repo:

- The usefulness of [Oh My ZSH!](http://ohmyz.sh/) is already built–in.
- [Spaceship](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt) as a prompt.
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)-like autosuggestion in Zsh.
- Syntax highlighting of commands while they are typed.
- Automatically closing and deleting of quotes and brackets when you type them.
- Browser-like substring search for history.
- [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) for dependency management.
- Lots of useful [aliases](./lib/aliases.zsh).
- Modern CLI tools like `eza` (smarter `ls`), `bat` (smarter `cat`), `zoxide` (smarter `cd`).
- Git config, global `.gitignore` file and aliases.
- Homebrew bundle for bootstrapping a macOS workstation.
- A lot of useful [bins](https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles/tree/master/bin).
- `update` script for updating dotfiles, Zsh plugins, brew, and apt packages.

## Installation

Dotfiles are installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal, just copy one of the following commands and execute in the terminal:

Tell Git who you are using these commands:

```sh
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.email "email@yoursite.com"
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.name "Name Lastname"
```

Clone dotfiles repo:

```sh
# Clone dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Go to the dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

`./install` also links [`agents/AGENTS.md`](./agents/AGENTS.md) into supported agent config directories when those directories already exist (`~/.codex`, `~/.cursor`, `~/.config/agents`, `~/.config/github-copilot`, and `~/.config/opencode`).

## Updating

Use single command to get the latest updates:

```sh
update
```

This command refreshes `sudo`, pulls the latest dotfiles, reruns `./install --except shell`, updates `zgen` and Zsh plugins, and updates `brew` when available.

## Under the hood

> **Note:** You may put your custom settings into `$DOTFILES/custom`.

### Projects tree

I suggest you to organize project folder as follows:

```txt
~/Projects
├── Forks       # for GitHub fork
├── Job         # for job projects
├── Playground  # for short-term experiments
└── Repos       # for long-term projects
```

### Aliases

Aliases are going to make your work fast and enjoyable. See code in `$DOTFILES/lib/aliases.zsh`. Here is what's included:

- Aliases from Oh-My-Zsh. See [Oh-My-Zsh Cheatsheet](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet#commands) for more.
